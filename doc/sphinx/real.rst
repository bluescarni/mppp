Multiprecision reals
====================

.. note::

   The :cpp:class:`~mppp::real` class and its ancillary functions are available only if mp++ was configured with the
   ``MPPP_WITH_ARB`` option enabled (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

Types
-----

.. cpp:type:: slong = implementation_defined

   This type is defined by the Arb library. It is a signed integral type with a bit size of 32 or 64 bits, depending
   on the platform.

.. cpp:type:: ulong = implementation_defined

   This type is defined by the Arb library. It is an unsigned integral type with a bit size of 32 or 64 bits, depending
   on the platform.

Concepts
--------

.. cpp:concept:: template <typename T> mppp::RealInteroperable

   This concept is satisfied if the type ``T`` can interoperate with :cpp:class:`~mppp::real`.
   Specifically, this concept will be ``true`` if ``T`` is :cpp:concept:`CppInteroperable`, :cpp:class:`~mppp::integer`, or
   :cpp:class:`~mppp::rational`.
