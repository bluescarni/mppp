   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_QUADMATH_HAVE_EXP2Q

   .. versionadded:: 0.27

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for a quadmath library version
   providing the ``exp2q()`` function
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_QUADMATH_HAVE_LOGBQ

   .. versionadded:: 0.27

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for a quadmath library version
   providing the ``logbq()`` function
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_WITH_BOOST_S11N

   .. versionadded:: 0.22

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for the Boost.serialization library
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_WITH_FMT

   .. versionadded:: 0.27

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for the fmt library
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_FLOAT128_WITH_LONG_DOUBLE

   .. versionadded:: 0.22

   This macro is defined if mp++ was configured with support for the quadmath library
   and the ``__float128`` type can be used in mixed-mode operations with ``long double``
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>` and the
   :ref:`platform-specific notes <inst_plat_specific>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_WITH_MPFR

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for the MPFR library
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_WITH_MPC

   .. versionadded:: 0.20

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for the MPC library
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_WITH_ARB

   .. versionadded:: 0.19

   This name is defined if mp++ was configured with support for the Arb library
   (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_HAVE_GCC_INT128

   This name is defined if mp++ detects the presence of the GCC-style 128-bit integers
   ``__int128_t`` and ``__uint128_t``, available on some compiler/platform combinations.

.. c:macro:: MPPP_STATIC_BUILD

   .. versionadded:: 0.15

   This name is defined if mp++ was built as a static library, instead of a dynamic
   library (see the :ref:`installation instructions <installation>`).

.. c:macro:: MPPP_HAVE_STRING_VIEW

   .. versionadded:: 0.17

   This name is defined if mp++ detects the availability of the ``std::string_view``
   class (available since C++17).
