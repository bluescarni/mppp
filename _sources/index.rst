mp++
====

mp++ is a C++11/14/17/20 library for multiprecision arithmetic,
featuring:

* arbitrary-precision integers,
* arbitrary-precision rationals,
* quadruple-precision floats,
* quadruple-precision complex numbers,
* arbitrary-precision floats,
* arbitrary-precision complex numbers.

Design goals include:

* excellent performance for small integer and rational
  operands,
* easy embeddability in computer algebra systems and
  generic C++ libraries,
* a large collection of arbitrary-precision special functions,
* an ergonomic API based on modern C++ idioms.

Design non-goals include:

* support for fixed-size wide integrals (i.e., no ``uint512_t``,
  try `Boost Multiprecision <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/index.html>`__
  instead).

Built on top of the GNU multiprecision stack (`GMP <https://gmplib.org/>`__,
`MPFR <https://www.mpfr.org>`__, `MPC <http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/>`__),
mp++ was initially conceived as a GMP wrapper with special focus on performance with
small operands. In particular, a small buffer optimisation and custom
implementations of basic mathematical primitives are instrumental in
achieving a performance increase, with respect to GMP and other integer
multiprecision libraries, which can be
substantial (see the :ref:`benchmarks <benchmarks>` section).

Over time, mp++ has accrued many additional features, including
multiprecision real and complex number types, and an expanding
library of special functions (built in part on top of the excellent
`Arb <https://arblib.org/>`__ library).

mp++ is a spinoff of the `Piranha <https://github.com/bluescarni/piranha>`__ library, released under the
`MPL2 <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/>`__ license.
